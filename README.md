hmm... This is a personal self-use ahk script. It makes my workflow much more convenient.
  
Some of the features I emulated [Live Enhancement Suite](https://github.com/LiveEnhancementSuite/LESforWindows) for reference. Hope you find it useful!
  
Actually, my code so sucks... I guess no one will notice it. Just let it be a backup yup :)
  
~~And my English sucks~~
  
## How To Run
  
1. Download & Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/)
  
2. Run `nvz_workflow-tools.ahk` with AutoHotKey v2
  
3. Then you can start making a DOoOoOoOoOPE song...
